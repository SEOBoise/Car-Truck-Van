Additionally, advanced driver-assistance systems, which include technologies like lane departure warning and forward collision warning, provide an extra layer of safety by alerting the driver to potential hazards and assisting in avoiding accidents.<br><br>By thoroughly researching and comparing the safety features offered by different truck models, you can make an informed decision that aligns with your safety priorities and ensures a safer driving experience.</p>
